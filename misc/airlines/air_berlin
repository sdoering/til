I learned, that Air Berlin seats have not that much space. Glad I only had to endure 1.5 hours of domestic flight in Germany every second the seat in front of me torturing my kneecaps. 

People on a flight should at least have that much respect, to not drop their whole weight into their seat, if someone is right behind their seat. That hurts. And people next to each other might sometimes respect a little bit of personal space. 

I cannot understand, why reading the newspaper has to happen right in my face.
